/**
 * <p>
 * <h2>JDWP Specification</h2>
 * Notification of a new running thread in the target VM. The new thread can be
 * the result of a call to {@link java.lang.Thread#start()} or the result of
 * attaching a new thread to the VM though JNI. The notification is generated by
 * the new thread some time before its execution starts. Because of this timing,
 * it is possible to receive other events for the thread before this event is
 * received. (Notably, Method Entry Events and Method Exit Events might occur
 * during thread initialization. It is also possible for the
 * {@link VirtualMachineCommand#ALLTHREADS} command to return a thread before
 * its thread start event is received.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that this event gives no information about the creation of the thread
 * object which may have happened much earlier, depending on the VM being
 * debugged.
 * </p>
