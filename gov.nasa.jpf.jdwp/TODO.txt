1. ObjectId.write() should be untagged contrary to Value.write() which is tagged!

-> ObjectId.write() and ObjectId.writeTagged()
-> Value.write() and Value.writeUntagged()

2. Use objectIdManager as late as possible (in the whole Event facility for instance) - it will speed up everything
  -> we don't need objectId for an object we're not sure we will send across JDWP (like when creating FieldModificationEvent)
